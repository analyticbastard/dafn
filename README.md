# dafn

Define asynchronous functions, just like any common function

```clojure
(dafn limited-resource [params]
    (process-and-get-status))
```

`limited-resource` will return a promise that will be realized when the body
is processed for its call.

```clojure
(let [p (limited-resource x)]
    (some-other-process)
    (when (realized? p)
        (more-processing @p)))
```

`limited-resource` can be called from several threads concurrently

## Limitations

As a macro, this comes with certain limitations. In particular
- No variable arguments allowed
- You cannot deconstruct in the argument definition
